# dnd5tools
Searchable index of all things fifth edition... eventually.

Just check out http://radai.github.io/dnd5tools to give a test run.
It searches classes, races, feats, spells, items, and monsters, and give a rough dump of info into a card of sorts.
It'll get cleaned up one day, but the funcitonality is growing.

Used primarily for my players and I to communicate and double-check RAW (rules as written) for powers/spells/items/etc.

The XML data provided is retrieved from ceryliae's repo over at https://github.com/ceryliae/DnDAppFiles of which I've only contributed the Blood Hunter info. Help if you can! Especially with all the new stuff coming out soon!
